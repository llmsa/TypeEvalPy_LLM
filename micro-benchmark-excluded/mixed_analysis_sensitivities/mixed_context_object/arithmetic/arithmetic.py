# This program is an example of context and object sensitivity as it uses an object to store the input values and the computed result.
# The behavior of the program depends on the context object passed to the 'arithmetic_op' function, which contains the input values 'a' and 'b', as well as the computed result.
# The 'result' field is accessed and modified in a context-sensitive manner, where the behavior of the program depends on the specific context object that is used.
