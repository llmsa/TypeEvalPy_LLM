# Program defines a class called IdentityOperation which takes one parameter x in its constructor, and has a method called identity that simply returns the x attribute. # The class also has a member variable called result that stores the result of the computation.
# This is object and inter procedural sensitive and the behavior of the identity method depends on the type of the x attribute of the instance and it calls another function ' operation'
