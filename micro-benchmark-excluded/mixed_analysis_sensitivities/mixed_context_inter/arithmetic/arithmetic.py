# A simple Python program that defines a function called 'arithmetic_op' which calls another function 'add' to perform addition of two integer parameters 'a' and 'b'.
# The given code is interprocedural because it involves calling a separate function ('add') to complete the arithmetic operation.
# Program is also context sensitive as it differ in context of function calls


def arithmetic_op(a, b):
    result = add(a, b)
    return result


def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    return result


x1 = 2
y1 = 1
result1 = arithmetic_op(x1, y1)

x2 = 3.0
y2 = 2.0
result2 = arithmetic_op(x2, y2)

x3 = "Hello"
y3 = "World"
result3 = arithmetic_op(x3, y3)
